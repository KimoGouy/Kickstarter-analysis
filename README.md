Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
From the Box and Whiskers plots, we can see that the mean campaiging goal is around £4,000.This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged.  In addition, half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged. So, Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000.
